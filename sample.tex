\begin{abstract}
This document briefly describes how to write technical reports using \LaTeX.  It is certainly not a comprehensive description of either good technical writing or \LaTeX.  The former topic is covered very well in~\cite{High93} and the latter in~\cite{Lamp86}.
\end{abstract}

\section{Background}
Background content.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
This is the introduction to your report.  In this section you will tell the reader what you are going to say in the body.  If it is a long report, you might even sketch out what you will say, section by section.  Generally you will write the introduction and conclusions {\it after} the body.

\section{The Body--Background and Notation}
In Section~\ref{intro}, we discuss what goes into an introduction.  Here you will discuss your findings.  You will probably have multiple sections.  The first section will usually describe the {\it general} problem you are addressing, giving the reader some background and context for the coming sections.  You should also list any notation that is unusual or new.

Somewhere in this section you should probably include the following Equation~\ref{svd_equation}.  You can always refer back to it by using the notation
\begin{verbatim}
~\ref{svd_equation}
\end{verbatim}

\begin{equation}
\label{svd_equation}
A = U \Sigma V^T
\end{equation}
where $A$ is $m$-by-$n$ with singular values $\sigma_1 \ge \sigma_2 \ge \ldots \ge \sigma_n \ge 0$, $U$ and $V$ are orthogonal matrices and $\Sigma = diag(\sigma_1,\sigma_2 \ge \ldots, \sigma_n)$.

\section{The Body--Defining Terms, Concepts, and Procedures using Lists}

Use bulleted and enumerated lists to define terms, concepts, and procedures to help your reader learn and later reference important content.  For terms and concepts use the \texttt{itemize} environment:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Term:} Usually a noun with specific technical meaning.  Use 2--3 sentences even if your text provides a fuller description.
    \item \textbf{Concept:} Often 2--3 words that you use as short-hand for describing an idea.  Similar to a term.  Also use 2--3 sentences to describe it for later reference.
    \item \textbf{Procedure:} Any step-by-step process, including algorithmic sketches or workflow processes.
\end{itemize}

To create lists we show, by example, what procedure to use:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Choose the kind of list:} Use the \texttt{itemize} environment for terms and concepts.  Use the \texttt{enumerate} for procedures
    \item \textbf{Use bold text to list each item:} List each term, concept or step as an \texttt{\\item} followed by a colon character ``:''
    \item \textbf{Provide a brief description:} For each item, provide a 2--3 sentence description, even if you provide a more detailed description in the main text
    \item \textbf{End each description with or without a period:} Be consistent in the use of a period ``.'' or not at the end of each description. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{The Body--Problem Setup and Solution}

Once you have the background material complete, you should set up the problem you are solving and discuss what particular issues you are studying.  In the case of the LSI project, you should discuss what { \it specific } questions you will address and how you will find the answers.

Somewhere in this section you should probably include the following Equation~\ref{equation2}:
\begin{equation}
\label{equation2}
A_k = U_k \Sigma_k V_k^T
\end{equation}
where $A_k$ is an $m$-by-$n$ matrix of rank $k$ with singular values $\sigma_1 \ge \sigma_2 \ge \ldots \ge \sigma_k \ge 0$, $U_k$ and $V_k$ are the first $k$ columns of $U$ and $V$, respectively, from Equation~\ref{svd_equation}, and $\Sigma_k = diag(\sigma_1,\sigma_2 \ge \ldots, \sigma_k)$.




\section{The Body--Results}

In this section you should present your results and tell the reader your findings based on these results.  Be very specific here.  Also, the use of tables, for example, Table~\ref{mytable}, is a great idea in this section (as well as in other places) so you might put in something like this:

\begin{table}[ht]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l||c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
              &\multicolumn{5}{|c|}{Value of $k$ in
                                    Equation~\ref{equation2}.}\\ \hline
{\em Term-Doc Matrix} &  4 & 8 & 16 & 32 & 64 \\ \hline\hline
     CRAN             &  8 &10 & 12 & 14 & 16 \\ \hline
     CISI             &  9 &11 & 13 & 15 & 17 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{table:docs_returned} Number of Documents Returned as a
function of $k$ for each of the Term-Document Matrices.}
\end{center}
\label{mytable}
\end{table}

\section{Figures}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.25\textwidth}

\centering
\includegraphics[frame, scale=0.1]{LaTeX_Lion.pdf}
\caption{\footnotesize This figure is drawn from a PDF file that 
was included, scaled and inserted into wrapped text.  Use the \LaTeX\ 
source as a starting point for inserting your own figures.}
\label{fig_latex_lion}

\end{wrapfigure}
Inserting figures into \LaTeX\ documents can be complicated.  One strategy (which is a good general strategy for working with \LaTeX\ documents) is to refer to existing documents as templates for specific types of constructs.  For example, you can refer back to this document to see how Figure~\ref{fig_latex_lion} is expressed in \LaTeX\ source code. Web searches are also an excellent resource for getting detailed information about \LaTeX\ strategies.  You don't have to struggle alone in trying to get \LaTeX\ to work!

\caption{\footnotesize The \LaTeX\ source shown in this figure was used to generate Figure~\ref{fig_latex_lion}.  Note that \LaTeX\ places figures for you.  You do not have direct control over figure placement, but can ``coach'' \LaTeX\ when you get some experience behind you.}

Figure~\ref{fig_latex_lion_source} shows the \LaTeX\ source that generated Figure~\ref{fig_latex_lion}.


\section{The Conclusion}

Here you will synthesize what you have already said, bringing out the most relevant points and conclusions you have made, and explicitly making points that may have been implicit.  You may want to enumerate or list your conclusions.  If so you could do so as follows:


\begin{enumerate}
\item This is an enumerated list.
\item All items are listed with numbers.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item This is an itemized list.
\item All items start with a bullet.
\begin{itemize}
\item Note:  It is possible to nest these lists.
\begin{enumerate}
\item To many depths.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
