abstract = {Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) software is typically developed using research funding where the primary focus is research and development of advanced algorithms and modeling capabilities. As a result, formal software engineering is seldom a primary goal. CSE software developers intend to write good software, but often lack the training, resources or time to adopt advanced formal methods and practices. In this paper, we present a list of practices identified from the Trilinos project that we believe most CSE software teams can adopt and from which they can benefit.},

abstract = {The scientific community relies on the peer review process for assuring the quality of published material, the goal of which is to build a body of work we can trust. Computational journals such as the ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software (TOMS) use this process for rigorously promoting the clarity and completeness of content, and citation of prior work. At the same time, it is unusual to independently confirm computational results.ACM TOMS has established a Replicated Computational Results (RCR) review process as part of the manuscript peer review process. The purpose is to provide independent confirmation that results contained in a manuscript are replicable. Successful completion of the RCR process awards a manuscript with the Replicated Computational Results Designation.This issue of ACM TOMS contains the first [Van Zee and van de Geijn 2015] of what we anticipate to be a growing number of articles to receive the RCR designation, and the related RCR reviewer report [Willenbring 2015]. We hope that the TOMS RCR process will serve as a model for other publications and increase the confidence in and value of computational results in TOMS articles.},
